# Workforce Management API

This project is a fully functional Workforce Management API built with **Spring Boot**. It was developed as part of a backend engineering challenge, starting from a single-file concept and evolving into a well-structured, multi-layered application. The API allows managers to create, assign, and track tasks for their employees.

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

  * **Language:** Java 17
  * **Framework:** Spring Boot 3.0.4
  * **Build Tool:** Gradle
  * **Dependencies:**
      * Spring Web
      * Lombok
      * MapStruct
  * **Database:** In-memory data store (Java Collections)

## Part 1: Bug Fixes üêû

Two critical bugs in the initial codebase were identified and resolved.

### Bug 1: Task Re-assignment Creates Duplicates

  * **Problem:** When a task was reassigned to a new employee, the old task remained active, causing duplicate entries.

  * **Fix:** The logic was updated to ensure that when a reassignment occurs, the new task is assigned, and any previous active tasks for that same reference are marked as **`CANCELLED`**. This maintains a clean state with only one active task per job.

  * **How to Test:**

    1.  Send a `POST` request to reassign tasks for `reference_id: 201`.
    2.  Fetch the individual tasks to verify one is updated and the other is cancelled.


    
    # Step 1: Reassign the task

    # Step 2: Verify by fetching task ID 4 & 5, its status should be CANCELLED

### Bug 2: Cancelled Tasks Clutter the View

  * **Problem:** The endpoint for fetching tasks for an employee was returning `CANCELLED` tasks, which cluttered the user's active work list.
  * **Fix:** A filter was added to the service logic to explicitly exclude any tasks with a `CANCELLED` status from the response.
  * **How to Test:** Send a `POST` request to fetch tasks for users `1` and `2`. The cancelled task (ID 6) will be absent from the results.

## Part 2: New Features ‚ú®

The API was enhanced with three highly requested features.

### Feature 1: "Smart" Daily Task View

  * **User Need:** A true "today's work" view that shows all open tasks, including older ones that are still active.
  * **Implementation:** The task fetching logic was enhanced to return all **`ASSIGNED`** or **`STARTED`** tasks that either started within the requested date range OR started before the range but are still open.
  * **How to Test:** The test for Bug \#2 above also demonstrates this feature, as it correctly fetches tasks based on the new logic and date range.

### Feature 2: Task Priority

  * **User Need:** The ability for managers to set and filter tasks by priority.
  * **Implementation:** A `priority` field (`HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`) was added to the `Task` model. Two new endpoints were created: one to update a task's priority and one to fetch all tasks of a specific priority.
  * **How to Test:**
    <img width="732" height="823" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a7723b1-a709-42bb-ac28-ffeb156f220e" />

    # Example 2: Fetch all tasks with MEDIUM priority

### Feature 3: Task Comments & Activity History

  * **User Need:** A full audit trail for each task, including automatic logs and manual user comments.
  * **Implementation:** An event system was created to log key activities (creation, status change, etc.) automatically. An endpoint was also added to allow users to post free-text comments. When a single task is fetched, its complete history and comments are included, sorted chronologically.
  * **How to Test:**
    <img width="1263" height="905" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d824c8f0-8474-41a7-9c12-dcc26ec4d889" />


    # Step 2: Add a comment to task 13

    # Step 3: Fetch task 13 to see the full, sorted history
